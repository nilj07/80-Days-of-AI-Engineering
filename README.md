# 🚀 80-Day AI/ML Engineer Transformation

![AI/ML Engineering](https://img.shields.io/badge/Focus-Production--Grade%20ML-blue?style=for-the-badge)

This repository serves as the official documentation of my **80-Day AI/ML Execution Plan**. My goal is to transition from foundational concepts to deploying production-grade Generative AI systems.

### 🧪 Experimental Rigor & Documentation
A key focus of this journey is moving beyond "black-box" modeling. I document the **Engineering Process** for every project:

* **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Systematic exploration of settings (Learning Rates, Batch Sizes, Regularization).
* **A/B Testing:** Comparing different architectures and algorithms.
* **Visual Analysis:** Documenting results through feature importance plots, loss curves, and confusion matrices.
* **Optimization:** Focus on reducing latency and improving inference efficiency.

### 📈 The 3-Phase Roadmap
1.  **Phase 1: Foundations (Days 1-26)** * Python Memory Models, DSA, ML Mathematics, and Supervised/Unsupervised Pipelines.
2.  **Phase 2: GenAI & LLMs (Days 27-55)** * Attention Mechanisms, RAG Systems, and Production-grade LangChain Applications.
3.  **Phase 3: Flagship Projects & MLOps (Days 56-80)** * System Design, CI/CD for ML, and building a production-ready AI Code Reviewer.

### 🏁 Guiding Principles
* **Code + Notes + Explain Out Loud:** True mastery comes from teaching.
* **Production First:** Not just training models, but building APIs and Dockerizing solutions.
* **Data-Driven:** Every decision is backed by experimental logs and metric tracking.
